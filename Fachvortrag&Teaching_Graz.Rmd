# Social Media as a Tool

* Frequent data: daily changes
* Historical data: data before and during early phase of event
* Collective emotions: interactions between people
* Indirect measures: No (emotional) memory or reporting biases 
Check terms from bit by bit

Advantages: 
* Cost and efficiency
* Includes people hard to reach with surveys

# My research vision for Graz

* Systematically explore role of expressed and experienced emotion in association of media content and suicides
  - Protective: Suicidal ideation, LOGIC song
  - No effect: Informational Prevention Campaign
* Influence of emotions and social processes on the spreading of information online
* Developing digital interventions that target socio-emotional mechanisms
* Foster attention to accurate and protective information & societal cause areas

# Teaching Concept

### Teaching at the Interface of Psychology & Computer Science <br> <br> in the Master of Computational Social Systems

### Mag. Dr. Hannah Metzler


---

## My Approach to Teaching

**Designed to encourage**
- Interleaved learning 
- Active learning: Linking theory & research practice
- Critical reflection on: 
    - the probabilistic nature of social science findings
    - the quality of study design & methods
    - the robustness and strength of scientific evidence
    => necessity of good research practices
- Participation
- Regular feedback to adapt teaching & foster motivation

???
Active learning: with regular exercises
When teaching psychology, critical r particularly necessary
reflect on the social impact of research?
Taking the student perspective to ensure motivation

Quantitative testing theories from the social sciences at unprecedented
breadth and depth and scale.</span>

* New data sources (e.g. the Web and Social Media)

* New methods (e.g. Machine Learning, Simulation)

* Breadth: quantifying many things at the same time

* Depth: measuring a lot about each person

* Scale: gathering data on many people

Slide on types of digital research?
1) Observation
* Online data: behavior in digital environments
* Digital data created by devices in the physical world (supermarkets, phones)
* Government records (health, unemployment...)

2) Experimentation
* Online experiments: on social media or via surveys
* Crowdsourcing (Mechanical Turk)
* Research with digital technologies: neuroimaging, virtual reality, serious games...

3) Asking questions
* Online surveys

4) Mass collaboration
